# Get Your Web3Forms Access Key

To make the RSVP form work, you need a free access key:

## Steps:

1. Go to https://web3forms.com/

2. Scroll down to "Get Started Free"

3. Enter your email: **theskript@gmail.com**

4. Click "Get Access Key"

5. Check your email for the access key (it's a long string like: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7g8h-9i0j-k1l2m3n4o5p6`)

6. Open `index.html` and find line with:
   ```html
   <input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE">
   ```

7. Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE` with your actual access key

## That's it!

Once you add the access key, the form will:
- Send RSVPs directly to theskript@gmail.com
- Work without opening email clients
- Be completely free (up to 250 submissions/month)
- No account needed beyond getting the access key

The form is already set up - just add the key and it works! 🎉
